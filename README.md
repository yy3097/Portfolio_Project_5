# Portfolio Project: Campaign Strategy
This repository is part of the portfolio uses for SFU MDM application only. 

This project is a course project from the Business Analytics course I took during my previous graduate study. All codes are completed in Python. 


## Project Description
This is a collaborative Business Analytics course project, which is aimed to analyze the campaign strategy of a company. Logistic Regression is used to apply machine learning on the dataset to predict customer response to other variables, in order to figure out the impact of each variable has on the probability that a certain customer will attend a future campaign, as well as the expected profit the company could made through the predicted campaign. 


## Work Done
I have completed the first 1/3 of “Data Processing”, the entire “Probability Attending Future Campaign” part, and the “Part One Conclusion”.


## File Description
**IEOR E4650 Project.ipynb:** all codes of the project, collaborated by our group of 4 people. 

**IEOR E4650 Project.pdf:** a preview of all codes, outcomes and results of our analysis. 

The dataset we used in this project is stored remotely and been read into the code from Google Drive. 


## Outcome
The outcomes and the whole progress towards them can be viewed directly in either the Jupyter Notebook file or the pdf file. We concluded that different campaign should be limited in frequencies and be recommended to different group of customers according to their purchase styles to make the greatest profit.
